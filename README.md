This mobile app was designed to to inform the users about the current situation of Covid-19 in Malaysia. It was designed for EEMakerthon that was held during Covid-19 lockdown. I was in charge to visualize the data extracted from the database Firebase. My teammates gathered the data through web scrapping from the Internet, and they stored the data in Firebase. 

This app was made using Flutter in Android Studio. Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for various platform (mobile, web, and desktop) from single database. We only managed to develop this app in Android. In the future, we planned to develop the app in other platforms.
