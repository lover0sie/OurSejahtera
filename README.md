This app is designed to inform users about the current situation of COVID-19 in Malaysia and educate Malaysians about fake news regarding COVID-19 and vaccinations that was circulating the Internet. It was made for EEMakerthon during the COVID-19 lockdown in Malaysia. I was in charge of data visualization while my teammates gathered the data through web scrapping and stored the data in Firebase. 

This app was made using Flutter in Android Studio. Android Studio is an official IDE for Android app Development. Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for various platforms (mobile, web and desktop) from a single codebase. However, we only managed to develop this app for mobile. We hope to develop the app on various platforms in the near future. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please run the program through "main.dart" and make sure that the mobile device is available before running the program in Android Studio
